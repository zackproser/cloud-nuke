# cloud-control-backed refactor

Currently working: 

- This simple config file: 

```yaml
ResourcesToNuke: 
  - "AWS::Logs::LogGroup"
  - "AWS::IAM::Role"

```

Results in the cloud-nuke binary in this repo being able to list the following resources in my test account:

```
‚ùØ aws-vault exec nuketest --no-session -- ./cloud-nuke aws --region us-east-1
[cloud-nuke] INFO[2022-07-25T22:40:49-04:00] The following resource types will be nuked:

## Code-diff 

See the current changes here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/compare/master...zackproser:cloud-nuke:master

The potential for simplification (and the possiblility of unlocking all current and future AWS cloudcontrol-compliant resources for free), appears significant.
